    <li>I created <a href="https://heypolls.com/">Hey, Polls!</a> to make voting simple, fun, and engaging. You can find a few notes about it <a href="https://danijelgrabez.com/blog/heypolls">on my blog</a>.</li>
    <li>Currently, I’m building a tool that lets anyone seamlessly add a feedback widget to their blog or website. Coming soon to a browser near you! <a href="https://www.heylikey.com/">• ᴗ •</a></li>
